I have always thought about starting a blog about things I make/create or the study I do. But, The first thing on my mind is I don't want to write a blog on BlogSpot or a WordPress site. I always wanted to design my own blog site. Since, I was not having any coding background it was difficult to me to completely design a website. It took me a long time to search the way to design a website with minimal coding. Later on, I came across the static websites. I read about it, and thought to make a static website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). At the end of the year just few days before Diwali, I started developing this blog site. As I have done minimal things, now I will be going live. I finished the setup of this blog site on 1st of November 2021, but I wrote this first post on 6th of November.

Finally, I welcome you all to my blog, where I will post different things I learn and make.
